# HDK Explorations

## Holochain in Action #23

### Goals

We accomplished these goals:

- Unpacking get_details response after multiple creates of the same entry
- Printing a debug representation of entries

And began to lay the groundwork for these:
- Walking trees of entry updates by multiple parties
- Filtering update tree branches to only valid ones

And left this one for a future session:
- Countersigning flow

### Branches

Initial repo state is in branch `holochain-in-action-23-start`.

Repo state at the end of this session is in branch `holochain-in-action-23-end`.

Notes, readme, etc are in branch `holochain-in-action-23`.
