### Holochain in Action #23

Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOZMfpwANx8

#### Goals

We accomplished these goals:

- Unpacking get_details response after multiple creates of the same entry
- Printing a debug representation of entries

And began to lay the groundwork for these:
- Walking trees of entry updates by multiple parties
- Filtering update tree branches to only valid ones

And left this one for a future session:
- Countersigning flow
